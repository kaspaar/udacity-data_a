Here you can find projects done by myself as milestones during Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.
All projects have passed the assessment, but if you find any inconsistency or error, please let me know!

The numbering is chronological, so chances are the later projects were approached with more skill :)

TOC:
Project 1 - Welcome to Nanodegree Program		Quick introductory task
Project 2 - Introduction to Data Analysis		Exploratory Data Analysis relying mainly on Python and Pandas
Project 3 - Practical Statistics			A/B tests, regression models, hypothesis testing, confidence, sampling
